This is a AI project I am developing that will serve four functions for me. I am also using it
as a learning tool for myself on how AI works.

    To run:
        1) get your own api key for chatgpt
        2) add the key into a new .env file
        3) npm install openai dotenv readline
        4) type 'node index.js' into terminal
